# Decision-Tree-Navigator-
A simple Java console-based decision tree navigator that guides users through a series of yes/no questions based on predefined nodes.

## How It Works
- The program starts from an initial node.
- Users are prompted to enter **yes** or **no**.
- Based on the response, the program navigates to the next corresponding node.
- The process continues until the end of the decision tree is reached.

## Features
- Console-based interactive decision flow
- Handles invalid inputs by prompting the user again
- Follows a yes/no branching logic

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.
3. Run the `UserInteraction.java` class.
